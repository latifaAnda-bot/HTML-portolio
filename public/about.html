<hr />

<p>I am a Somali-born Norwegian entrepreneur and international business developer with experience in the EMEA region. As a Latifa development founder, I help develop businesses covering digital branding, digital marketing, strategy, leadership, and UX design. Mother of two, writer, and speaker of English, Norwegian, and twelve Arabic dialects. I earned my bachelor's in Economics and Business Administration from Stavanger University.</p>

<p>During Corona, I realized the dramatic change in our society and how fast things go. The real danger was to be left aside without the required knowledge, and this time forever. We are witnessing a paradigm change in the industry, technology, energy, and what we can perceive as the new oil today in water, agriculture, and IT businesses. And that made me start studying for a master's in Energy environment and society in 2020 while serving as a security guard. In 2021, I joined the UX design institute in Glasgow, which helped me to gain quite a knowledge on how to solve a current social problem by designing a digital product that makes the life of the end users more significant.</p>

<p>I look forward to working together; I will focus on adding more advantages and growth to your organization and being part of the Green Transition through digitalization and ESG.</p>
