<h1>The Best Movies According To Latifa</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Get Out</h3>

<p>This is my favorite because it makes me reflect on systematic social manipulation and the ways power structures shape and control public perception. It reminds me how important it is to step outside those influences and think independently.</p>
<hr />
<h3> Eat Pray and Love </h3>

<p>I love this movie because it helped me rediscover myself and gave me the clarity and courage to move forward with my divorce. After nearly eleven years, I’ve never been happier. It really makes you reflect on who you are, where you stand in this world, and how to create balance within yourself.</p>

<h3>Pretty Woman</h3>

<p>I love this movie because it taught me:<ul> 
        <li>Everything is possible when you are in love.</li>
        <li>Carry yourself with dignity and integrity, regardless of your circumstances.</li>
</ul></p>
